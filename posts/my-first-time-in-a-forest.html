                <p>In October 2016, when I was ten years old, we (my family and I) travelled to
<a href="https://www.ranthamborenationalpark.com/" title="Ranthambore National Park"><em>Ranthambore National Park</em></a>, famous for its large population of tigers, as part of our trip to Rajasthan. I had no idea what to expect, never having been to a national park before, but I was excited at the prospect of spotting a tiger in the wild.</p>

<p>I remember seeing many of a particular species of bird and wondering what it was, until I found out - I don’t remember how — that it was called a <em>red-wattled lapwing</em>. That was the beginning of a journey of fascination with birds and birdwatching that continues today. Just last month while river-rafting I saw a lapwing and fondly recalled my long-ago hunt to identify it — until I was distracted by my father and sister being thrown overboard into the Ganga by a large set of rapids. But that’s a story for another time.</p>

<p>As we went deeper into the forest, it felt like we had somehow stumbled into the centre of <em>The Lion King</em>. A sambar deer suckled its fawn while a herd lounged on the ochre grass, peacocks ran alongside our vehicle before vanishing back into the undergrowth, and an inquisitive spotted deer peered at us from behind a tree as another one crowned with huge antlers nibbled at a bush.</p>

<p>Most surprising of all, however, was the <em>rufous treepie</em>, which fearlessly perched on our canter railing and even walked over some safarigoers hands!</p>

<p>We did four safaris without seeing a single tiger, but we were far from disappointed - how could we be, with all the other amazing creatures that are foreign to a resident of Mumbai who knows only pigeons and rats? Animals aside, the experience of being in a forest - an outsider in a seemingly chaotic world of sprawling trees and tall grasses filled with mysterious lurkers — was an amazing experience in itself.<br />
<br></p>
<p>Thus ended the memorable trip to Ranthambore, but it was just the beginning of a life closer to nature.</p>
