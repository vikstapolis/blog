In October 2016, when I was ten years old, we (my family and I) travelled to 
[*Ranthambore National Park*](https://www.ranthamborenationalpark.com/ "Ranthambore National Park"), famous for its large population of tigers, as part of our trip to Rajasthan. I had no idea what to expect, never having been to a national park before, but I was excited at the prospect of spotting a tiger in the wild.

I remember seeing many of a particular species of bird and wondering what it was, until I found out - I don't remember how &#8212; that it was called a *red-wattled lapwing*. That was the beginning of a journey of fascination with birds and birdwatching that continues today. Just last month while river-rafting I saw a lapwing and fondly recalled my long-ago hunt to identify it &#8212; until I was distracted by my father and sister being thrown overboard into the Ganga by a large set of rapids. But that's a story for another time.

As we went deeper into the forest, it felt like we had somehow stumbled into the centre of *The Lion King*. A sambar deer suckled its fawn while a herd lounged on the ochre grass, peacocks ran alongside our vehicle before vanishing back into the undergrowth, and an inquisitive spotted deer peered at us from behind a tree as another one crowned with huge antlers nibbled at a bush.

Most surprising of all, however, was the *rufous treepie*, which fearlessly perched on our canter railing and even walked over some safarigoers hands!

We did four safaris without seeing a single tiger, but we were far from disappointed - how could we be, with all the other amazing creatures that are foreign to a resident of Mumbai who knows only pigeons and rats? Animals aside, the experience of being in a forest - an outsider in a seemingly chaotic world of sprawling trees and tall grasses filled with mysterious lurkers &#8212; was an amazing experience in itself.

Thus ended the memorable trip to Ranthambore, but it was just the beginning of a life closer to nature.

[^1]: The red-wattled lapwing is also called the "Did-you-do-it" bird, because of its loud accusatory call which sounds like those words.
