    Welcome to my blog. I'm Vikram, a 16 year-old student in Mumbai, India.

    Wildlife has fascinated me since I was young, and I've decided to post
    here about my experiences on jungle safaris, birdwatching, and
    <b>?simply?</b> observing the creatures hidden in the concrete jungle of my
    city.
