Welcome to my blog. I'm Vikram, a 16 year-old student in Mumbai, India.  

Wildlife and nature have attracted me since I was young &mdash; my
parents tell me that even as a toddler I was captivated by the sight of birds.

Over the years, I've observed all sorts of exotic life forms
in national parks, bird sanctuaries, week-old sandwiches forgotten in backpacks,
and even hidden in the concrete jungle of my city.  

In the hustle-bustle of everyday life, we often let ourselves become
oblivious to the natural world that exists outside of human civilisation.
The detached solitude of patiently observing a *chestnut-headed bee-eater* until
it finally wins its meal with a graceful arc through the air serves as a
welcome reminder that there is a beautiful world beyond the confines of
man-made constructs.

Over the past few years, my interest has turned into a passion for birdwatching and nature photography (although animals
of any kind are enough to pique my interest). This blog aims to capture some of my
experiences &mdash; and hopefully inspire you to better
appreciate the fascinating fauna all around us.
